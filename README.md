# JavaScript Bug: Unexpected Result with Null and Undefined Arguments

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving the handling of null and undefined values in function arguments.  The `foo` function correctly handles null values but fails to account for undefined arguments, potentially leading to unexpected results or runtime errors.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers. It correctly handles cases where either `a` or `b` is explicitly `null`. However, it does not address the scenario where either `a` or `b` is `undefined`. This oversight can cause unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with functions that might receive arguments from external sources, where the absence of a value might manifest as `undefined` rather than `null`.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves extending the conditional statement to explicitly check for both `null` and `undefined` values, ensuring that the function behaves as intended regardless of whether a missing argument is represented as `null` or `undefined`.
